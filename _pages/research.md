I have broad interests in computer architecture and systems. My research focuses on more efficient and resilient system architecture design. My current focused topics include:

- **Large-scale Datacenter Optimization**: How to enhance the shared datacenters in ... 
  - LLM serving efficiency on scalable CPU with matrix acceleration units.  [In submission]
  - resource visibility in shared-state scheduler architecture. [[SoCC'23](/files/xinkai_not_all_socc2023.pdf)]
  - request visibility of microservice-level parallelism. [[IPDPS'22](/files/xinkai_exploring_efficient_ipdps2022.pdf)]
  - power-aware management of serverless computing systems. [IPDPS'23, CCGRID'24, SCIS'25]
- **Efficient Management Facilities**: How to eliminate the additional costs of ...
  - intra-service tracing facility for cloud datacenters. [[ASPLOS'25](/files/xinkai-asplos2025.pdf)]
  - power management facility for autonomous embedded systems with shadow cycles. [[ICCD'24](/files/xinkai_continuous_energy_iccd2024.pdf), TACO'24]
  - resource management facility for autonomous embedded systems. [In submission, RTSS'24]
- **Resilient Architecture Design**: How to design low-cost hardware fault tolerance architecture for complex LLM training and serving workloads in future AI infrastructure? [Ongoing]
