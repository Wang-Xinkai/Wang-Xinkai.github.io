Hi, I am Xinkai Wang. 
Currently, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in CSE Department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am honored to be guided by [Prof. Chao Li](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html) in [Sustainable Architecture and Infrastructure Lab](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/sail/) (SAIL) at [EPCC Center](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor's degree with Zhiyuan honors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021.

My research focuses on more efficient and resilient system architecture design, especially on datacenter optimization, efficient facilities, and resilient architecture. If you are interested in my project details and further collaborations, feel free to contact me.
